\title{Metric: Size of selfloops}
\usage{
size_of_selfloops(eventlog, type, level_of_analysis, raw = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{The event log to be used. An object of class
\code{eventlog}.}

\item{type}{Type of selfloops. I.e. repeat or redo}

\item{level_of_analysis}{At which level the analysis of selfloops should be performed: log, case, activity, resource, resource activity.}

\item{raw}{Return raw data (only applicable for log level)}
}
\description{
Provides summary statistics on the sizes of selfloops at the level of activity types, cases, traces or log. A selfloop of size x refers to the occurrence of x consecutive events
of that activity type.
