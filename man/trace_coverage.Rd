\title{Metric: Trace coverage}
\usage{
trace_coverage(eventlog, level_of_analysis = c("log", "trace", "case"),
  threshold = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{The event log to be used. An object of class
\code{eventlog}.}

\item{level_of_analysis}{At which level the analysis of  coverage should be performed: log, case or trace.}

\item{threshold}{The threshold to be used for the analysis at log level. Default is at 0.8 (80\%)}
}
\description{
Analyses the structuredness of an event log by use of trace frequencies. Applicable at logn case and trace level

Trace: The absolute and relative frequency of each trace is returned

Case: for each case, the coverage of the corresponding trace is returned

Log: The number of traces to cover a certain percentage (default is 80\%) of a log is computed. If a tie exists, the two nearest points are returned.
