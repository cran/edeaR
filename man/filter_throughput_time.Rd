\title{Filter: Throughput Time}
\usage{
filter_throughput_time(eventlog, lower_threshold = NULL,
  upper_threshold = NULL, percentile_cut_off = NULL, reverse = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{The event log to be used. An object of class
\code{eventlog}.}

\item{lower_threshold}{The lower duration threshold, specified in number of days.
When \code{reverse} is FALSE, all cases with a lower duration are discarded.}

\item{upper_threshold}{The upper duration threshold, specified in number of days.
When \code{reverse} is FALSE, all cases with a higher duration are discarded.}

\item{percentile_cut_off}{Alternatively to providing thresholds, a percentile cut off can be provided.
A percentile cut off value of 0.9 will return the 90\% shortest cases.
When \code{reverse} is set to TRUE, it will return the 10\% longest cases.}

\item{reverse}{A logical parameter depicting whether the selection should be reversed.}
}
\description{
Filters cases based on their throughput time.
