#'@title Metric: Start activities
#'
#'@description At log level, computes how many activity types occur as the first event in a case, both absolute and relative.
#'At activity level, shows the activities which occur as first, and how often.
#'The first event in a case is the one which started the first.
#'#'
#' @param level_of_analysis At which level the analysis of start activities should be performed: log, case, activity, resource and resource-activity.
#'
#' @param eventlog The event log to be used. An object of class
#' \code{eventlog}.
