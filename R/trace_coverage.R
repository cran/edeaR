#' @title Metric: Trace coverage
#'
#' @description Analyses the structuredness of an event log by use of trace frequencies. Applicable at logn case and trace level
#'
#' Trace: The absolute and relative frequency of each trace is returned
#'
#' Case: for each case, the coverage of the corresponding trace is returned
#'
#' Log: The number of traces to cover a certain percentage (default is 80\%) of a log is computed. If a tie exists, the two nearest points are returned.
#'
#' @param eventlog The event log to be used. An object of class
#' \code{eventlog}.
#'
#' @param level_of_analysis At which level the analysis of  coverage should be performed: log, case or trace.
#'
#' @param threshold The threshold to be used for the analysis at log level. Default is at 0.8 (80\%)
#'
#' @export trace_coverage
