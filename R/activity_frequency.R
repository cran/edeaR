#' Metric: Activity Frequency
#'
#'
#' Provides summary statistics about the frequency of activity types at the level of log, traces, cases, activity types.
#'
#'
#' \itemize{ \item At log level, This metric shows the summary statistics of the frequency of activities throughout the complete event log.
#' \item  On the level of the cases, this metric showsthe absolute and relative number of times the different activity types occur in
#' each case. The absolute number shows the number of distinct activity types
#' that occur in each of the cases. The relative number is calculated based on the total activity executions in the case. \item On trace level, this metric
#' presents the absolute and relative number of times a specific activity type occurs in each trace. \item On the level of the activities, this metric
#' provides the absolute and relative frequency of a specific activity in the complete event log.

#' @param eventlog The dataset to be used. Should be a (grouped) eventlog object.
#' \code{eventlog}.
#'
#' @param level Level of granularity for the analysis: log, trace, case, activity. For more information, see \code{vignette("metrics", "edeaR")}
#' @param append Logical, indicating whether to append results to original event log. Ignored when level is log or trace.
