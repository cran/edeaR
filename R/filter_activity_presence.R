#' Filter: Activity Presence
#'
#' Filters cases based on the presence (or absence) of activities
#'
#' This functions allows to filter cases that contain certain activities.
#' It requires as input a vector containing one or more activity labels and it has a method
#' argument. The latter can have the values all, none or one_of.
#' \itemize{
#' \item When set to `all`, it means
#' that all the specified activity labels must be present for a case to be selected
#' \item `none` means
#' that they are not allowed to be present.
#' \item `one_of` means that at least one of them must be
#' present.
#' }
#'
#' When only one activity label is supplied, note that methods all and one_of will be identical.

#' @inherit filter_activity params references seealso return
#'
#' @param method Filter method. If "all", each of the activities should be present. If "one_of", at least one of them should be present. If "none", none of the activities are allowed to occur in the filtered traces.
