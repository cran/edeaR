#'@description At log level, computes how many activity types occur as the last event in a case, both absolute and relative.
#'At activity level, shows the activities which occur as last, and how often.
#'The last event in a case is the one which completed the last.
#'
#' @param level_of_analysis At which level the analysis of end activities should be performed: log, case, activity, resource or resource-activity.

#' @param eventlog The event log to be used. An object of class
#' \code{eventlog}.
